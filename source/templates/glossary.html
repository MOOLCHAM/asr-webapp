            <p id="circlerunway"><strong>Circle to Runway {Runway Number}</strong><br />Used by ATC to inform the pilot that he/she must circle to land because the runway in use is other than the runway
            aligned with the instrument approach procedure. When the direction of the circling maneuver in relation to the airport/runway is required, the controller will state the direction (eight cardinal
            compass points) and specify a left or right downwind or base leg as approprate; e.g., "Cleared VOR Runway Three Six Approach circle to Runway Two Two," or "Circle northwest of the airport for a right
            downwind to Runway Two Two."</p>
            <p id="clearance"><strong>Clearance</strong><br />An authorization by air traffic control for the purpose of preventing collision between known aircraft, for an aircraft to proceed under specified
            traffic conditions within controlled airspace. The pilot-in-command of an aircraft may not deviate from the provisions of a visual flight rules (VFR) or instrument flight rules (IFR) air traffic
            clearance except in an emergency or unless an amended clearance has been obtained.<br /><br />Additionally, the pilot may request a different clearance from that which has been issued by air traffic
            control (ATC) if information available to the pilot makes another course of action more practicable or if aircraft equpment limitations or company procedures forbid compliance with the clearance issued.
            Pilots may also request clarification or amendment, as appropriate, any time a clearance is not fully understood, or considered unacceptable because of safety of flight. Controllers should, in such instances
            and to the extent of operational practicality and safety, honor the pilot's request.<br /><br /><i>14 CFR Part 91.3(a)</i> states: "The pilot in command of an aircraft is directly responsible for, and is the
            final authority as to, the operation of that aircraft." <strong>The pilot is responsible to request an amended clearance if ATC issues a clearance that would cause a pilot to deviate from a rule or regulation,
                         or in the pilot's opinion, would place the aircraft in jeopardy.</strong></p>
            <p id="clearancevoid"><strong>Clearance Void If Not Off By {Time}</strong><br />Used by ATC to advise an aircraft that the departure clearance is automatically cancelled if takeoff is not made prior to

            It is normally used in training so that an instructor can evaluate a student's performance under changing situations. Pilots should advise ATC if they decide to remain on the runway, of any delay in their stop and go,
            delay clearing the runway, or are unable to comply with the instruction(s).</p>
            <p id="clearthrough"><strong>Cleared Through</strong><br />ATC authorization for an aircraft to make intermediate stops at specified airports without refiling a flight plan while en route to the clearance limit.</p>
            <p id="clearland"><strong>Cleared to Land</strong><br />ATC authorization for an aircraft to land. It is predicated on known traffic and known physical airport conditions.</p>
            <p id="climbvfr"><strong>Climb to VFR</strong><br />ATC authorization for an aircraft to climb to VFR conditions within Class B, C, D, and E surface areas when the only weather limitation is restricted visibility. The aircraft must
            remain clear of clouds while climbing to VFR.</p>
            <p id="complyrestrictions"><strong>Comply with Restrictions</strong><br />An ATC instruction that requires an aircraft being vectored back onto an arrival or departure procedure to comply with all altitude and/or speed restrictions depicted
            on the procedure. This term may be used in lieu of repeating each remaining restriction that appears on the procedure.</p>
            <p id="contactapproach"><strong>Contact Approach</strong><br />An approach wherein an aircraft on an IFR flight plan, having an air traffic control authorization, operating clear of clouds with at least 1 miles flight visibility and a reasonable expectation
            of continuing to the destination airport in those conditions, may deviate from the instrument approach procedure and proceed to the destination airport by visual reference to the surface. This approach will only be authorized when
            requested by the pilot and the reported ground visibility at the destination airport is at least 1 statute mile.</p>
            <p id="continue"><strong>Continue</strong><br />When used as a control instruction should be followed by another word or words clarifying what is expected of the pilot. Example: "continue taxi," "continue descent," "continue inbound," etc.</p>
            <p id="csigmets"><strong>Convective SIGMET</strong><br />A weather advisory concerning convective weather significant to the safety of all aircraft. Convective <a href="#sigmet" class="navy-link">SIGMET</a>s are issued for tornadoes, lines of thunderstorms, embedded thunderstorms of any intensity level, areas

            <p id="crossfixabove"><strong>Cross {Fix} at or Above {Altitude}</strong><br />Used by ATC when an altitude restriction at a specified fix is required. It does not prohibit the aircraft from crossing the fix at a higher altitude than specified; however,
            the higher altitude may not be one that will violate a succeeding altitude restriction or altitude assignment.</p>
            <p id="crossfixbelow"><strong>Cross {Fix} at or Below {Altitude}</strong><br />Used by ATC when a maximum crossing altitude at a specific fix is required. It does not prohibit the aircraft from crossing the fix at a lower altitude; however, it must be at or above the minimum
            IFR altitude.</p>
            <p id="cruise"><strong>Cruise</strong><br />Used in an ATC clearance to authorize a pilot to conduct flight at any altitude from the minimum IFR altitude up to and including the altitude specified in the clearance. The pilot may level off at any intermediate
            altitude within this block of airspace. Climb/descent within the block is to be  made at the discretion of the pilot. However, once the pilot starts descent and verbally reports leaving an altitude in the block, he/she may not return to that altitude without additional
            ATC clearance. Further, it is approval for the pilot to proceed to and make an approach at destination airport and can be used in conjunction with:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>An airport clearance limit at locations with a standard/special instrument approach procedure. The CFRs require that if an instrument letdown to an airport is necessary, the pilot shall make the letdown in accordance with a standard/special
                    instrument approach procedure for that airport, or</li>
                    <li>An airport clearance limit at locations are within/below/outside controlled airspace and without a standard/special instrument approach procedure. Such a clearance is <strong>NOT AUTHORIZATION</strong> for the pilot to descend under IFR conditions
                    below the applicable minimum IFR altitude nor does it imply that ATC is ecercising control over aircraft in Class G airspace; however, it provides a means for the aircraft to proceed to destination airport, descend, and land in accordance with applicable CFRs governing VFR
                    flight operations. Also, this provides search and rescue protection until such time as the IFR flight plan is closed.</li>

            <p id="mva"><strong>Minimum Vectoring Altitude (MVA)</strong><br />The lowest MSL altitude at which an IFR aircraft will be vectored by a radar controller, except as otherwise authorized for radar approaches, departures, and <a href="#missedapproach" class="navy-link">missed approaches</a>. The altitude meets IFR obstacle clearance criteria. It may be lower than the published <a href="#mea" class="navy-link">MEA</a>
            along an airway or J-route segment. It may be utilized for radar vectoring only upon the controller's determination that an adequate radar return is being received from the aircraft being controlled.
